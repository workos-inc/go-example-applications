# Go Admin Portal Example Applications

An example Golang application demonstrating how to use the [WorkOS Golang SDK](https://github.com/workos/workos-go) so your customers can access the WorkOS Admin Portal from your application.

## Go Project Setup

1. Clone the example repository using your preferred secure method (HTTPS or SSH).

   ```bash
   # HTTPS
   git clone https://github.com/workos/go-example-applications.git
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   # SSH
   git clone git@github.com:workos/go-example-applications.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository and to the admin portal:

   ```bash
   cd go-Example-Applications/go-magic-link
   ```

3. Obtain and make note of the following values. In the next step, these will be set as environment variables.

   - Your [WorkOS API key](https://dashboard.workos.com/api-keys)

4. Add this to your APIKey variable.

## Start the server

5. The final setup step is to start the server.

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   You'll know the server is running when you see no errors in the CLI, and output similar to the following is displayed:

   ```bash
   launching admin portal demo with configuration: {Addr::8000 Domains:}
   ```

   Set the default redirect URI as "http://localhost:8000/success" in your WorkOS Dashboard Configuration tab and navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the passwordless example app.

   Hooray!
