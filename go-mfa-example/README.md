# Go MFA Example Applications

An example Go application demonstrating how to use the [WorkOS Go SDK](https://github.com/workos/workos-go) for MFA.

## Prerequisites

- Go

## Go Project Setup

1. Clone this git repository using your preferred secure method (HTTPS or SSH).

   ```bash
   # HTTPS
   git clone https://github.com/workos/go-example-applications.git
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   # SSH
   git clone git@github.com:workos/go-example-applications.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository.

   ```bash
   cd go-example-applications/go-mfa-example
   ```

3. Obtain and make note of the following values. In the next step, these will be set as environment variables.

   - Your [WorkOS API key](https://dashboard.workos.com/api-keys)

4. Create a file called ".env" in the root of the project and add the following environment variables, replacing xxx with the values from your WorkOS dashboard.

   - WORKOS_API_KEY=xxx

5. The final setup step is to start the server.

   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

   You'll know the server is running when you see no errors in the CLI.

   Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser. You should see a "Users" button. If you click this link, you should see your users list.

   You can stop the local server for now by entering `CTRL + c` on the command-line.
